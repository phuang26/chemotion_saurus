## Generic Segments and Elements

Generic elements and segments are structured according to the different levels **layer** and **field**. Each generic element or segment can contain different, multiple **layers** and each layer can consist of multiple and differnt **fields**. 



| type | availability | dependencies | explanation |
|---|---|---|---|
| text |---|---|---|
| system defined |---|---|---|
| select |---|---|---|
| integer |---|---|---|
| input group |---|---|---|
| formula field |---|---|---|
| drag molecule |---|---|---|
| drag sample |---|---|---|
| checkbox |---|---|---|
| text area |---|---|---|
| add dummy field |---|---|---|


###  Field-Type: System-defined 

The field type **System-defined** allows to add values with a unit. Units are assigned to certain standards in the community of the research field but should meet common conventions and definitions. Depending on the unit that is used, different conversions are available.
